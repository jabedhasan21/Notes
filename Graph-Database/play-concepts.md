# Play Concepts
## Graph Fundamentals:
A graph database can store any kind of data using a few simple concepts:

1. Nodes - graph data records
2. Relationships - connect nodes
3. Properties - named data values

## A Graph Database
Neo4j stores data in a Graph, with records called Nodes.
+ Nodes are the name for data records in a graph
+ Data is stored as Properties
+ Properties are simple name/value pairs

# Nodes
+ Similar nodes can have different properties
+ Properties can be strings, numbers, or booleans
+ Neo4j can store billions of nodes

## Labels: 
+ Associate a set of nodes.
+ Nodes can be grouped together by applying a Label to each member.
+ A node can have zero or more labels
+ Labels do not have any properties

## Consider Relationships
+ Relationships always have direction
+ Relationships always have a type
+ Relationships form patterns of data

# Relationship properties
+ In a property graph, relationships are data records that can also contain properties.
